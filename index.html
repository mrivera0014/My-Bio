    <p>Hi everyone, I go by Marble and I'm from Denver, CO. I have worked at Starbucks for a few years now and I am excited to
    start learning about coding. I started looking into coding a little over year ago and had originally planned on going to
    a coding school earlier this year, but unfortunately the pandemic happened and plans changed. My hobbies consist of
    listening and finding music and going to concerts (pre-pandemic of course). Can't wait to start learning!!</p>
